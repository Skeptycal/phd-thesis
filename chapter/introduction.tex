\begin{description}

\item[\chapref{background}] sheds light on the context of this work.
	We present a quick overview of language-side reflection followed by a development of \VM-level reflection.
	We find that mostly metacircular \VMs provide limited \VM-level reflection and thus we present several high-level language \VMs falling into this category.
	We conclude that there is only two research \VM that has a uniform model for \VM and language-side.
	Among them is \P a research \ST \VM we contributed to previous to working on this thesis.

\item[\chapref{reification}] focuses on language-side applications that simplify the interaction with the underlying \VM.
	We present a custom inspector framework that is now used by default in \PH.
	As a second part we explain how we introduced first-class layouts and slots to \PH to reify the low-level structural layout of objects.
	Both projects are crucial for metacircular \VM development and are direct results from the research conducted on the \P \VM.

\item[\chapref{benzo}] describes a high-level low-level programming framework named \B.

	\todo{main contribution \B in \chapref{benzo}}\\
	\todo{- adding holes to the VM first primitive low-level interactoin}

\item[\chapref{ffi}]
	\todo{\B is the main framwork, what follows is a real world validation of \B with \FFI in \chapref{ffi}}\\
	\todo{- quick 1-2 sentence outline of \NB}\\
	\todo{- shows that \B is feasible and even fast, even though full control at language-side}

\item[\chapref{validation}]
	\todo{Secondary / prototype \B validation in \secref{validation}}\\
	\todo{- \WF outline in \secref{validation-waterfall}}\\
	\todo{- \NBJ outline in \secref{validation-nabujito}}

\item[\chapref{future}]
	\todo{From the prototype/application we see certain limitations of \B which means things to improve in \secref{future}}\\
	\todo{- main debuggin improvement}\\
	\todo{- use of a high-level platform independent intermediate format}\\
	\todo{- step back and follow a new kind of \VM wich has less restrictions}
