\noindent Many high-level programming languages run on top of a virtual machine (\VM) which provides certain advantages from running directly on the underlying hardware.
Many high-level language \VMs pursue a strict separation between language-side and \VM-side.
\VMs for instance provide automatic memory management or use platform agnostic instructions such as bytecodes.
These properties allow a programming language to develop independently from the underlying hardware.
One such feature is dynamic reflection, the capability of a language to reason about itself.
In an extended form, reflection allows a program to alter its own structures and execution.
Originally \VMs are built in performance oriented low-level programming languages such as C which on their own support little or no reflection at runtime.
Hence, rather incidentally, reflection is limited to the language-side.

However, there are other \VMs that are implemented using high-level languages which support reflection themselves.
More specifically we see that metacircular \VMs encourage advanced reflective features and new ways of interacting with the low-level \VM world.
Metacircular \VMs are implemented in the same language they support.
Typically this enables a more flexible building process where more high-level structures survive the compilation process.
The final language-runtime can profit from this and support high-level low-level programming.
In several research \VMs this concept is used to implement typically isolated \VM components at language-side.
But instead of generating a native version at \VM generation time, these components are evaluated at language-side, with the only difference that they have the capability to directly interact with low-level code.
This means that the original separation of language-side and \VM is no longer evident.

A language-runtime where \VM components are implemented at language-side also enables extended forms of reflection.
With the same reflective tools it is now possible to inspect and alter \VM-level objects.
However, this approach requires substantial effort as the \VM has to be designed from ground up in a new way.
In this thesis we would like to follow a different approach with the same goals in mind.
Instead of a holistic approach, we want to identify a minimal interface for performing high-level low-level programming or even extend reflection down to the \VM.
We look for an approach which works on top of an existing high-level language \VM.

To answer these questions we propose the high-level low-level programming framework \B written for \PH.
In the core \B allows us to dynamically activate native code from language-side.
This adds a primitive yet generic interface to the low-level \VM world.
To validate \B we describe three distinct applications built on top of it.
%
\begin{description}
	\item[\FFI:] The first one is an efficient foreign function interface (\FFI) library that is built at language-side without additional \VM support.
	Our \FFI library outperforms existing solutions on \PH.
	
	\item[Dynamic Primitives:] The second applications uses \B to dynamically generate and modify \PH primitives by reusing the metacircular \VM sources.
	By combining high-level reflection and \B's low-level performance we outperform pure \PH-based primitive instrumentation.
	
	\item[Language-side \JIT:] As a third, prototype application we show how \B is used to build a language-side \JIT.
	Our prototype shows the limits of possible \VM interactions using the \B framework. 
\end{description}

\section{Problem Statement}
% =============================================================================
Following the problem description listed in the above introduction we identified the following abstract concerns with existing reflective languages and their \VMs.
%
\begin{itemize}
	\item Reflection and in special behavioral reflection comes at a significant cost due to reification overhead.
		
	\item Intercession is limited to language-side.
	\VMs are not accessible from language-side and they are usually have no reflective properties at runtime. 
	
	\item Existing approaches to a unified model between the \VM and the language-side are holistic, there is no intermediate solution available.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Out of these general problems concerning reflection in high-level languages we see that they have a low-level root.
To address the unification of the language-side and \VM-side we have to grant more access to the language-side.
This includes interacting directly with low-level native instructions.
A similar problem has been solved by applying high-level low-level programming in a more static environment \cite{Fram09a,Graal}.
%\sm{Laurie knows a little about Graal (Oracle labs), so, as another language-side JIT, I would mention it}
The approach outlined by Frampton et al. uses a high-level framework to generate native code at compile-time.
We see that their approach has not yet been applied in a more dynamic environment where native code has to be generated at runtime.
Hence we focus on the following concrete problems we wish to solve in this thesis.

\begin{description}
	\item[Problem 1:] High-level low-level programming is not available at runtime.
	
	\item[Problem 2:] Intercession is limited to language-side.
	\VMs are not accessible from language-side and they are usually have no reflective properties at runtime.
	
	\item[Problem 3:] High-level low-level programming has not yet been provided as an incremental extension to an existing language runtime.

We present now our contributions of this dissertation addressing the previously identified problems concerning high-level low-level programming in a dynamic language:

\begin{description}
	\item[\B] is a high-level low-level programming framework written in \urlfootnote{\PH}{http://pharo.org/}. \todo{by Igor Sasenko}
	The core functionality of \B is to dynamically execute native-code generated at language-side.
	Our framework requires minimal changes to an existing \VM and three custom primitives to support dynamic code activation, the majority of \B is implemented as accessible language-side code.
	\B allows us to directly communicate with the low-level world and thus hoist typical \VM-level applications to the language-side.
	\sm{Just a shift of implementation language, opens up opportunities, but in itself, doesn't give more reflective power, it is still 'a runtime', no? }
		
	\item[\NB] is a \B-based foreign function interface (\FFI).  \todo{by Igor Sasenko}
	\NB makes generates customized native code at language-side, both being flexible and efficient at the same time.
	\NB outperforms other existing \FFI solutions on the \PH platform, making it an ideal evaluation for the \B framework.
	
	\item[\NBJ] is a prototype \JIT compiler based on \B.
	\NBJ generates the same native code as the \VM-level \JIT by compiling the high-level bytecode intermediate format at language-side.
	Our \B-based \JIT prototype reuses existing \VM-level infrastructure and focuses only on the dynamic code generation.
	However, since there is no well-defined interface with the \VM \NBJ requires an extended \VM with an improved \JIT interface to dynamically install native code.
	
	\item[\AsmJIT] is a assembler framework written in \PH.
	\AsmJIT is the low-level backend for the previously mentioned \B framework.
	We extended the existing assembler framework to support the full 64-bit x86 instruction set.

%	\item[\Eye] is a high-level inspector framework that has now been adopted in \PH.
%	Inspectors are crucial when interacting with the low-level world which typically lacks the structural abstractions present at language-side.
%	\Eye allows us to rapidly define customized views for \PH objects.
%	Our inspector framework seamlessly integrates into the existing \PH debugger.
%	\sm{Eye is very different, the introspection aspect is very important for low level programming, I think you'll need to adapt your story line to include that aspect explicitly, if you want to include eye/emphasise it}

\section{Outline}
% =============================================================================

\sm{This dissertation structure is different to what I am used to. At least the way you announce the purpose of the chapters is not what I would expect.

In my diss, everything revolves around one thesis, here, it is a number of things listed one after another, don't see the central motive I would expect}

\begin{description}
\item[\chapref{background}] sheds light on the context of this work.
	We present a quick overview of language-side reflection followed by a development of \VM-level reflection.
	We find that mostly metacircular \VMs provide limited \VM-level reflection and thus we present several high-level language \VMs falling into this category.
	We conclude that there is only two research \VM that has a uniform model for \VM and language-side.
	Among them is \P a research \ST \VM we contributed to previous to working on this dissertation.

%\item[\chapref{reification}] focuses on language-side applications that simplify the interaction with the underlying \VM.
%	We present a custom inspector framework that is now used by default in \PH.
%	As a second part we explain how we introduced first-class layouts and slots to \PH to reify the low-level structural layout of objects.
%	Both projects are crucial for metacircular \VM development and are direct results from the research conducted on the \P \VM.

\item[\chapref{benzo}] describes a high-level low-level programming framework named \B.
	The core functionality of \B is to dynamically execute native-code generated at language-side.
	\B allows us to hoist typical \VM plugins to the language-side.
	Furthermore we show how code caching makes \B efficient and users essentially only pay a one-time overhead for generating the native code.
	
\item[\chapref{ffi}] presents \NB, a stable foreign function interface (\FFI) implementation that is entirely written at language-side using \B.
	\NB is a real-world validation of \B as it combines both language-side flexibility with \VM-level performance.
	We show in detail how \NB outperforms other existing \FFI solutions on \PH.

\item[\chapref{validation}] focuses on two further \B applications.
	In the first part we present \WF a framework for dynamically generating primitives at runtime.
	\WF extends the concept of metacircularity to the running language by reusing the same sources for dynamic primitives that were previously used to generate the static \VM artifact.
	In a first validation we show how \WF outperforms other reflective language-side solutions to instrument primitives.
	
	In a second part of \chapref{validation} we present \NBJ a prototype \JIT compiler that is based on \B.
	\NBJ shows the limitations of the \B approach as it required a customized \VM to communicate with the existing \JIT interface for native code.
	Our prototype implementation generates the same native code as the existing \VM-level \JIT, however, it is currently limited to simple expressions.
	\NBJ shows that for certain applications a well-define interface with the low-level components of the \VM is required.

\item[\chapref{future}] summarizes the limitations of \B and its application, furthermore we list undergoing efforts on the \B infrastructure and future work.

\item[\chapref{conclusion}] concludes the dissertation.
