\todo{mainly structured around }\\

\begin{description}

\item[\chapref{background}] sheds light on the context of this work.
	We present a quick overview of language-side reflection followed by a development of \VM-level reflection.
	We find that mostly metacircular \VMs provide limited \VM-level reflection and thus we present several high-level language \VMs falling into this category.
	We conclude that there is only two research \VM that has a uniform model for \VM and language-side.
	Among them is \P a research \ST \VM we contributed to previous to working on this thesis.

\item[\chapref{reification}] focuses on language-side applications that simplify the interaction with the underlying \VM.
	We present a custom inspector framework that is now used by default in \PH.
	As a second part we explain how we introduced first-class layouts and slots to \PH to reify the low-level structural layout of objects.
	Both projects are crucial for metacircular \VM development and are direct results from the research conducted on the \P \VM.

\item[\chapref{benzo}] describes a high-level low-level programming framework named \B.
	The core functionality of \B is to dynamically execute native-code generated at language-side.
	Our framework requires minimal changes to an existing \VM and three custom primitives to support dynamic code activation, the majority of \B is implemented as accessible language-side code.
	\B allows us to hoist typical \VM plugins to the language-side.
	Furthermore we show how code caching makes \B efficient and users essentially only pay a one-time overhead for generating the native code.
	\todo{something in the direction of relfection is missing here}
	
\item[\chapref{ffi}] presents \NB, a stable foreign function interface (\FFI) implementation that is entirely written at language-side using \B.
	\NB is a real-world validation of \B as it combines both language-side flexibility with \VM-level performance.
	We show in detail how \NB outperforms other existing \FFI solutions on \PH.

\item[\chapref{validation}] focuses on two further \B applications.
	In the first part we present \WF a framework for dynamically generating primitives at runtime.
	\WF extends the concept of metacircularity to the running language by reusing the same sources for dynamic primitives that were previously used to generate the static \VM artifact.
	In a first validation we show how \WF outperforms other reflective language-side solutions to instrument primitives.
	
	In a second part of \chapref{validation} we present \NBJ a prototype \JIT compiler that is based on \B.
	\NBJ shows the limitations of the \B approach as it required a customized \VM to communicate with the existing \JIT interface for native code.
	Our prototype implementation generates the same native code as the existing \VM-level \JIT, however, it is currently limited to simple expressions.
	\NBJ shows that for certain applications a well-define interface with the low-level components of the \VM is required.

\item[\chapref{future}] summarizes the limitations of \B and its application, furthermore we list undergoing efforts on the \B infrastructure and future work.

\item[\chapref{conclusion}] concludes the thesis.
