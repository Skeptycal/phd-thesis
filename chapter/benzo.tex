\section{Introduction}
\seclabel{benzo-introduction}
% ===========================================================================
In this chapter we present \B a framework that connects the low-level / \VM work with a reflective and dynamic language-side library.
Unlike more classical approaches \B does not resort to vast set of customized \VM primitives or plugins.
Instead it relies on a generic primitive to activated native code that is generated at language-side.

\B provides a unique experience of being extremely low-level yet using high-level concepts at the same time.
This is possible since the framework is implemented at language-side and tightly integrated into the \PH development environment.
In this chapter we present in detail how \B interacts with \PH and what the difficulties are.
The key components of \B are:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item A generic primitive to activate native code
\item \AsmJIT A language-side assembler
\item A language-side library for installing and activating native code
\end{itemize}

\noindent Based on \B we outline 3 unique applications in \secref{benzo-usecase}:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Foreign Function Interfaces (in more detail in \chapref{ffi})
\item Dynamic Primitives (in more detail in  \chapref{validation})
\item Language-side \JIT (in more detail in  \chapref{validation})
\end{itemize}

\section{Background}
\seclabel{benzo-background}
% ===========================================================================
High-level low-level programming \cite{Fram09a} encourages to use high-level languages such as \Java to build low-level execution infrastructures or to do system programming. 
It is successfully used in experimental high-level self-hosted virtual machines (\VMs) such as \Jikes~\cite{Alpe99a}.  
Frampton et al. present a framework that is biased towards a statically typed high-level language, taking strict security aspects into account.
Their approach promotes to address low-level system programming tasks with the tools and abstractions of high-level languages.
However, their solution has reduced applicability in a dynamic and reflective context.
By reflective, we refer to the combined capabilities to inspect (introspection) and change (intercession) the same execution concepts at runtime \cite{Maes87a}.

From a reflective point of view it seems natural to dynamically modify the \VM at runtime and not just at compile-time.
If we are able to modify the \VM from language-side we blur the line between these two distinct worlds, becoming indistinguishable to talk about the \VM or the language-side.
Hence throughout this chapter we use the term language runtime to refer to the running \VM combined with the language-side application.


% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Requirements}
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Extending the \VM is only one particular case of modifying or extending the complete language runtime.
Language-side libraries, reflective capabilities, \VM extensions or hybrid approaches are other possibilities which we discuss in detail in \secref{benzo-related}.
All these typical extension mechanisms are not sufficient if we want to modify the \VM from language-side, or in our terminology, to reflectively modify the language runtime. Furthermore these mechanisms are based on the fact that there is a clear barrier between language and \VM.
A solution that crosses these barriers requires the following properties:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item It must be \emph{reflective} in the sense it must support \emph{dynamic} changes of the language runtime (\VM) without requiring a system restart.
	\item It should imply minimal changes to the existing low-level runtime to \emph{considerably reduce development efforts}.
\end{enumerate}


% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{\B a Framework for Reflective Low-level Programming}
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

High-level low-level programming is a powerful technique for system programming without resorting to static low-level environments \cite{Fram09a,Wimm13a} that almost fulfills our requirements.
However, in a reflective setup it fails to comply with the first requirement mentioned in the previous paragraph: it does not allow reflective changes at runtime.
Our approach for overcoming this limitation consists of \B, a lightweight and reflective framework that dynamically generates native code from language-side and allows its execution on the fly.
It relies only on a small set of generic \VM extensions described in \secref{benzo-vm-requirements}, whereas the vast majority of the framework is implemented as a language-side library.

% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{\B Applications}
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In \secref{benzo-usecase} we advocate the contribution of \B by providing three different incremental examples that heavily use the framework.
Unlike typical implementations that would focus on writing them as \VM extensions, we implement them completely at language-side using \B:

\begin{description}
	\item[Language-side \FFI] A complete language-side Foreign Function Interface (\FFI) implementation, described in \secref{benzo-ffi} and in more detail in \chapref{ffi}.
	\item[Dynamic Primitives] A language-side compilation toolchain that replaces system primitives at runtime with customized code, described in \secref{benzo-waterfall} and in more detail in \secref{val-waterfall}. 
	\item[Language-side \JIT Compiler] A \JIT compiler that works at language-side and interacts with the \VM for code synchronization, described in \secref{benzo-nabujito} and in more detail in \secref{val-nabujito}.
\end{description}


\noindent Illustrated by these three distinct examples, the contributions of this chapter are:
\begin{enumerate} 
	\item A \emph{reflective} high-level low-level programming framework that encourages the extension of high-level language runtimes on the fly without the overheads imposed by pure high-level solutions. 
	\item A proof of concept of the proposal with the implementation and description of three different tools that heavily use reflective low-level programming and covers distinct scenarios.
\end{enumerate}


% ===========================================================================
\section{The \B Framework}
\seclabel{benzo-benzo}
% ===========================================================================
\B is implemented in \PH\footnote{\url{http://pharo.org/}}, a \ST inspired language.
\PH comes with all the reflective capabilities known from \ST where most language-side components can be altered dynamically.
\B is implemented at language-side and only requires the help of two simple and generic primitives to activate native code and resolve the entry point address position of referenced C functions.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{\VM Context}
\seclabel{benzo-vm-requirements}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\PH emerged from the Squeak project \cite{Inga97a}.
The \PH \VM (Cog) implementation \cite{Mira11a} also evolved from the original Squeak bytecode interpreter.
The current \VM uses a moving Garbage  Collector (GC) with two generations\gc{ref?} and uses a \JIT that applies basic register allocation to reduce stack load. 
This situation is not a direct requirement for \B but it is assumed as given and thus not further discussed in detail.
However, \B requires certain features that were not supported in the existing \VM implementation.
Mainly our requirement is being able to generate executable code and activate it at runtime.
This is general and essential so it applies to any \VM that wants to support dynamic code execution managed at language-side.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\paragraph{Executable Memory.}
\seclabel{benzo-exeutable-memory}
 
We use standard \ST objects to hold the generated native code.
However, by default the object memory is not executable.
This leaves two choices: mark the whole object memory executable or only move the objects with the native code to a special executable memory region.
We took the path of least resistance and marked the whole object memory as executable.
The other solution requires substantial changes for memory management. 
As the \VM has a moving GC we only access high-level \ST objects via an indirection from low-level code.
Another approach would have been to harness the fixed sized executable region used by the existing \JIT.
However, the \JIT space does not hold normal \ST objects but special low-level structures and uses its own special GC. 

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\paragraph{\VM Interaction.}
\seclabel{benzo-vm-interaction}

\todo{dig up the older versions of this section with the longer text}

The standard way in \ST to execute low-level code is to use a tag in the method definition. The following example shows such a method on the \ttt{Float} class.
%
\begin{stcode}[label={lst:benzo-basic-primitive}]{5}
* aNumber 
	<primitive: 49>
	^ aNumber adaptToFloat: self andSend: #*
\end{stcode}
%
Here we use the primitive 49 to call a \VM function which efficiently multiplies two floats. 
\figref{benzo-smalltalkPrimitive}-a describes the case where the primitive is successfully executed.
However, if the primitive is unable to do the operation, for instance if the argument \ttt{aNumber} is not a float, it will signal a failure which causes the \VM to execute the fallback \ST code in the method body.  
\figref{benzo-smalltalkPrimitive}-b describes it. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=1.1]{smalltalkPrimitive}
	\caption[\PH Primitive]{Generic primitive methods in \PH: a) A primitive completely bypasses the bytecode, b) A failing primitive executes the bytecode as fallback.}
	\figlabel{benzo-smalltalkPrimitive}
\end{figure}


\B uses the primitives as a gate to enter the low-level world from the language-side.
Our custom primitive then executes the generated native code and returns to language-side. 
This code is appended inside the compiled method object.
When the primitive is activated, it  accesses the currently executed compiled method via a \VM function. 
\figref{benzo-nativeCodeMethod} shows the structure of a \ST compiled method that has native code attached to it.
We see the primitive tag on top, followed by the literal frame which holds references to symbols and classes used in the method.
The subsequent \ST bytecode is the fallback code executed only if the primitive fails. Only then appears the native instructions.
A marker at the end of the compiled method called trailer type is used to flag methods that actually have native code attached to them.
%
\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=1.1]{nativeCodeMethod}
	\caption[\PH Compiled Method]{A standard \PH compiled method on the left and a method with appended native instructions generated by \B.}
	\figlabel{benzo-nativeCodeMethod}
\end{figure}

Since compiled methods are first-class objects it is possible to modify them at runtime and append the native code.
The primitive \ttt{primitiveNativeCall}, which is implemented by \B, is the responsible of running the native instructions in a \ST method.
The code example \ttt{interrupt3} shows a very basic application of our infrastructure.
In \secref{benzo-language-side}, through more detailed examples, we describe how \B uses \ST code to generate the native instructions.

\begin{stcode}[label={lst:benzo-basic-native-code}, caption={\ST method using \B for very basic low-level debugging.}, escapeinside={@}{@}]{5}
interrupt3
	<primitive: 'primitiveNativeCall' 
	 module: 'BenzoPlugin' >
	Benzo generate: [ :asm | asm int3 ]
\end{stcode}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\paragraph{Native Code Platform Interaction.}
\seclabel{benzo-platform-interaction}

To ensure that the code is compatible with the current platform a \VM specific marker is expected at the beginning of the native code on the compiled method.
Upon activation \B compares this marker with the one from the current \VM.
If they don't match, \B signals a failure that causes the \VM to evaluate the fallback \ST code.
With this elegant approach \B regenerates native code lazily on new platforms.
Moreover, it does not have to flush the native code when the application is restarted on the same platform.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\paragraph{Garbage Collector Interaction.}
\seclabel{benzo-gc-interaction}
\todo{dig up the older versions of this section with the longer text}

Compiled methods in \PH have a special section, the literal frame, which stores objects referenced in the bytecodes.
Bytecodes then only have indirect access to these objects by indexing into the literal frame.
This simplifies the implementation of the garbage collector as it only has to scan the beginning of each method for possible references to objects. 
So the GC only tracks \ST objects when they are in the method literal frame. 
The moving GC of the \VM used for \PH has a significant impact on the low-level code we can generate using \B.
For instance it is not possible to statically refer to language-side objects from native code as object addresses change after each garbage collection.
Modifying the GC to support regions of non-moving objects would solve this problem.
However, we chose to minimize the number of low-level \VM modification necessary to run our experiments and opted for a simpler solution.
\B accesses language-side objects through an indirection.
For indirectly accessing objects the \PH \VM already features a special structure, named \emph{external roots}.
This array has a fixed-location in memory which can be used to access moving language-side objects.
The GC updates the addresses in this \VM structure after each run.
Hence we have the static address of the external roots object as an entry point to statically access \ST objects.
%
\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=1.1]{externalRoots}
	\caption[Benzo External Roots]{Pointers to objects registered as external roots are pinpointed at fixed offset in global \VM-level object.
	}
	\figlabel{benzo-externalRoots}
\end{figure}
%
Summarizing, for accessing \ST objects within native code we first register it as an external root object and access it only indirectly.
This means that for native code, instead of a method-local literal array we share a global literal array as shown in \figref{benzo-externalRoots}. 
\B only adds an \ttt{Array} to the external root objects which is managed from language-side and administers all references.

%\revc{The external roots concept appears here first but the idea of "indirection" has been mentioned. The regular literal frame of compiled methods are discussed heavily; that would suggest that the generated native code could use relative offset from the code location and still be able to "pin-point" the literal slot in the literal frame. What is the downside of this approach? (And how slots in the external roots garbage collected?)}
%\gc{I'm not very interested with the comment above. But perhaps here it is a good place to say that once the native code start executing our \VM assures that a GC could not happen}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\paragraph{\JIT Interaction.}
\seclabel{benzo-jit-interaction}

When the \PH \VM starts the execution of dynamic generated code the execution environment changes slightly.
Similarly, when entering primitives or plugin code, the managed execution mode is left and a normal C-level execution environment is reestablished until the primitive finishes and the \VM jumps back to the jitted code. 
To avoid these context changes that imply a considerable performance overhead, we extend the \VM to support inlining of native code in the \JIT phase following the same strategy as other existing primitives which are inlined at \JIT-level.
The \B prologue and epilogue used for managing the low-level stack are replaced by an adapted version for the \JIT.
The performance boost of this optimization is further discussed in \secref{benzo-issues-performance}.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\paragraph{Error Handling.}
\seclabel{benzo-error-handling}

\todo{extend with an explicit example}

\B provides an error handling facility that allows to return high-level error messages from the low-level code. 
The native code builder provides a helper method called \ttt{failWithMessage:} 
that generates the proper assembler instructions to return a full error message.
This allows plugins to return clear and meaningful error codes, improving the debugging tasks and enabling a better interaction with users.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{\B's Language-Side Implementation}
\seclabel{benzo-language-side}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
As a key design decision, we determine to keep the interface to the low-level world minimal.
The following describes the features of \B at the high-level language-side.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\paragraph{Code Generation.}
\seclabel{benzo-code-generation}

\B delegates native code generation to a full assembler written in \ST. The following example shows how to use the assembler to generate the native code for moving \ttt{1} into the 32-bit register \ttt{EAX}.
%
\begin{stcode}{4}
Benzo x86 generate: [ :asm |
	asm mov: 1 asUImm to: asm EAX ].
\end{stcode}
%
The implementation first creates a slightly more abstract intermediate format.
The abstract operations can be extended by custom operations that may expand to several native instructions. For pragmatic reasons current implementation only supports \textsc{x86} and \textsc{x86-64}.
The full features of the high-level environment are available when generating native code.
Hence complex instruction sequences can easily be delegated to other objects.
In the following example we use a \VM helper to instantiate an array. It is worth noting that all are standard message sends:
%
\begin{stcode}{5}
Benzo x86 generate: [ :asm :helper | | register |
	register := helper classArray.
	register := helper 
		instantiateClass: register
		indexableSize: 10
	asm mov: register to: asm resultRegister ].
\end{stcode}
%
The \VM helper exposes a basic, low-level interface to access objects and its properties.
Additional methods cover the access to the external roots described in \secref{benzo-gc-interaction}.
In this case the \ttt{\#instantiateClass:indexableSize:} will generate the proper native code to call to a \VM function and make sure that the side-effects of a possible GC run are handled properly.
By default the value in the result register is returned back to the language-side. On \textsc{x86} this defaults to \ttt{EAX}.
In section \secref{benzo-usecase} we introduce more substantial applications based on \B.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\paragraph{Code Activation.}
\seclabel{benzo-code-activation}
 
A \B primitive is responsible for the native code activation which consists of three main steps:
%
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Check if there is native code in the actual compiled method and if it is compatible with the current platform.
	\item Generate native code if necessary.
	\item Activate the native code for execution.
\end{enumerate}
%
The example in \lstref{benzo-basic-native-code} uses \B's generator to create and install the native code which would trigger a low-level interrupt. Behind the scenes \B adds some more information to the code as the already mentioned platform marker. 
For activation \B uses reflective features to restart the method containing the native code.
Upon the second activation, after already generating the native code, \B moves the native code to the end of the compiled method and activates it.
This mechanism is shown in \figref{benzo-nativeCodeActivation}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=1.1]{nativeCodeActivation}
	\caption[\B Native Code Acivation]{\todo{Add Primitive Failure Link}Native code activation with \B: The first call triggers the code generation. Then the method is restarted and the native code executed.}
	\figlabel{benzo-nativeCodeActivation}
\end{figure}

% ===========================================================================
\section{\B in Practice}
\seclabel{benzo-usecase}
% ===========================================================================
\todo{keep this section as is and introduce forward pointers to the separate chapters}

In this Section, for illustrating better the contribution of the solution proposed, we will present different dynamic language-side applications and tools based on \B.
These implementations, a \FFI, dynamic primitives and a language-side \JIT, are typically done at \VM-level.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{\NB: \B-based Foreign Function Interface}
\seclabel{benzo-ffi}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\FFIs enable a programmer to call external functions without the need to implement additional \VM extensions.
\NB \cite{Brun13a} is a production-ready \FFI for \PH, developed on top of \B.
An \FFI implementation consists of two main parts: calling external functions and converting data between the two environments.
Typically a big percentage of these two parts are implemented at \VM-level with statically defined bindings.
Relying on \B's capability to dynamically generate and execute native code we developed a complete \FFI at language-side.
This way the \VM no longer requires to have a specific \FFI extension.

A very simple example to illustrate the functionality of \NB is to access the current environment variables with the \ttt{getenv} C function.
\ttt{getenv} takes a name as single argument and returns the value of that environment variable as a string:
%
\begin{stcode}{4}
getenv: name
    ^ FFI call: 'String getenv(String name)'
\end{stcode}
%
In this example \NB automatically detects, using reflection, that the argument for the \PH method corresponds to the one of the low-level C function.
The most important aspect about this example is that it is written with standard \ST code, a property that extends to almost the complete implementation.
\NB, additionally to the native code activation, relies on two simple primitives provided by \B to retrieve addresses of external functions (\ttt{dlsym}) and to load external libraries (\ttt{dlopen}).

\NB generates the glue code to call external functions dynamically at run time.
It relies on \B's features presented in \secref{benzo-language-side} to generate and activate native code at runtime.
This gives \NB a significant advantage over static approaches: the generated native code is specific to the callout.
For instance in the \ttt{getenv} example, the marshalling code for converting from the internal \PH strings to C strings is written a small assembler routine.
In this specific context, the assembler code is faster than any language-side code.
Yet \NB is very flexible since all these conversion routines are defined at language-side. 
Each language-side library can define its own highly efficient conversion routines for types that are used in \FFI callouts, which is not directly possible to do with a \VM extension.


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Reflective Primitives}
\seclabel{benzo-waterfall}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\todo{1-page summary of the reflective primitives example}
%\subsection{Use Case: Dynamic Primitive Instrumentation}
%\md{Remove use-case here and inline in 1.2 Bridging abstraction layers}
%\noindent To illustrate this limitation we take the example of dynamically intercepting \VM primitives. In most managed language runtimes, \VM primitives are used for essential tasks such as object creation or provide fundamental functionality that can not be obtained otherwise at language-side~\cite[page 52]{Gold83a}. Already the simple example of measuring the time spent in an essential primitive while executing a performance critical task is difficult to do efficiently.


%Reflective solutions at language-side could take advantage of the intercession capabilities that allow changing or augmenting almost any behavior at runtime. In practice, this does not work for primitives. In addition, reflectively measuring the duration of the time primitive itself will easily cause meta-recursion. Hence in general reflective instrumentation will not work on primitives used for the instrumentation itself. Thus efficiently instrumenting \VM primitives in a dynamic and reflective environment is not feasible in many cases.

%Naturally, if we leave the high-level realm there are efficient tools at hand for instrumentation. Existing solutions for efficient low-level instrumentation such as DTrace~\cite{Coop12a} work by installing static hooks. Though in a reflective language assumptions can change at runtime and thus static solutions are not appropriate. At the same time we clearly see that such instrumentation is not a typical high-level application. To combine these two worlds we need a different approach.


\todo{move most of this subsection to separate section in the validation chapter}
The \PH \VM (Cog) is developed in a language that is a subset of \ST, known as \Slang, which is transformed to C and then compiled using a standard C compiler.  
\Slang basically has the same syntax as \ST but is semantically constrained to expressions that can be resolved statically at compilation or code generation time and are compatible with C.
Hence \Slang's semantics are closer to C than to \ST. 

The primitives of the \VM are written in \Slang and that is why even in a highly reflective languages such as \ST, where almost every aspect of the language is available for inspection and modification \cite{Denk10a}, primitives can not be changed at runtime. They can only be intercepted with reflective techniques with considerable performance overheads.
This is an important limitation since primitives are, in general, performance demanding components.
\WF~\cite{Char13a}\footnote{\url{http://lafhis.dc.uba.ar/waterfall/}} is a tool that allows developers to change the code written in \Slang for primitives and translate it to native code at runtime.
This replaces the indirection via C that is used in the default compilation process.
Given that \Slang source code can be modified at runtime as any other \ST method, \WF fosters primitives to be dynamically adapted without imposing the common pure reflective techniques performance degradation.

From a high-level point of view \WF provides two services which work transparently: 
%
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Compilation of \Slang code on demand (lazily).
	\item A clear interface for executing, at runtime and from language-side, the native code generated.
\end{enumerate}
%
The first item allows to change the code of primitives at language-side and generate the corresponding native code when needed. 
It also provides the possibility to write methods or functionality with the same \ST syntax but with a static semantic. 
It consists essentially of a transformation toolchain that uses the \AST that is generated by the standard \PH compiler harnessing that \Slang and \ST have the same syntax. 
Then this \AST representation is translated to native code enforcing C-like \Slang semantics. The current prototype has only three fully implemented stages: \Slang to \AST, \AST to an \IR (between \TAC and \SSA) and finally \AST or \IR to native. The design is open for future additions at any level.
One typical enhancement missing is having different levels of intermediate representations with various techniques on code optimization and register allocation strategies as modern compilers propose \cite[Ch.\ 1]{Appe98a}. 
The second item enables the execution of the dynamically generated native code.
This includes for instance the finding of addresses of \VM internal symbols and all the effort to link the two worlds, \ST and native.
\WF relies on \B for most of this low-level functionality.
In particular \NB, the \B-based \FFI presented in \secref{benzo-ffi}, is used for interfacing with C libraries (\ttt{dlsym}). 

\paragraph{Primitives in \ST.}
As already partially explained, whenever a method is compiled with the \ttt{primitive} pragma as shown in \secref{benzo-vm-interaction} a flag is set on the \ttt{CompiledMethod}. 
If the \VM tries to activate such a method, instead of interpreting the bytecodes it calls the corresponding function at \VM-level~\cite{Gold83a}.
%The binding between primitives and numbers is described in a table indexed by number.
\ST distinguishes two types of primitives: essential and non-essential primitives.
Essential primitives are required for the bootstrapping and the essential operations of the language, such as creating a new object or activating a block.
The second category of primitives are mainly used for optimization purposes.

\paragraph{Dynamically Interchangeable Primitives.}
\WF uses \B's mechanism for replacing primitive methods with customized versions that are nativized dynamically as described in \secref{benzo-benzo}.
The loophole described there is exploited by \WF to enable dynamic modification of \VM behavior and hence bring primitives to life at language-side.


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\paragraph{Benefits} 
We identified two main benefits of changing \VM primitives at runtime:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Reducing \VM complexity by implementing non-essential primitives reflectively at language-side.
	\item Dynamic instrumentation of primitives.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Reducing \VM Complexity.}
\VM extensions are only justified in the presence of strong performance requirements (see \secref{benzo-related}).
All non-essential primitives fall into this category.
Using \WF, these primitives can be implemented at language-side.
This means that these primitives become first-class citizens of the high-level environment and thus evolve with less effort.

\paragraph{Essential Primitives.}
For essential primitives the previous argument does not hold since a static version is needed for a correct startup of the system.
These primitives can not be fully replace by a language-side implementation using \WF.
For instance, essential primitives are required for system startup.
They would trigger an endless recursion when booting up the system and trying to generate them using \WF at the same time.
However, nothing prevents from replacing essential primitives at runtime with customized versions, once the system startup is completed. 

\paragraph{Why do we need better instrumentation?}
Instrumentation of essential primitives from language side is an error-prone task falling in many cases in non-termination due to recursive loops. 
An example of this behavior, can be observed when changing the essential \ttt{basicNew} primitive, which is responsible for instantiating new objects.
Even a very simple instrumentation task such as printing the address in memory of the created object is problematic.
If during the printing process another object is created the very same instrumented \ttt{basicNew} primitive would be triggered.
Using reflective techniques it is possible to avoid this loop, however, with a considerable overhead.
With \WF we can forget about these issues since the instrumentation code will be implemented at the lowest level.
On section \secref{benzo-wf-performance} we show how \WF, the \B based approach for generating primitives on the fly, outperforms the reflective solutions for primitives instrumentation. 


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\paragraph{\WF Future.}
\todo{move to separate section in the validation chapter}
Currently \WF reimplements all \Slang arithmetic essential operations statically as native code templates.
The existing \JIT of the \PH \VM does exactly the same for performance reasons.
This is code duplication and should be avoided.
With the language-side \JIT compiler described on next section we can reuse the same code. Another plan for \WF is to use it for disconnecting most plugins defined at \Slang side from the \VM compilation process and dynamically nativize them on a lazy approach.
Finally, adding stages to the compiler with different levels of intermediate representations and applying optimizations to each would bring its performance closer to completely low-level optimized primitives.


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{\NBJ \JIT Compiler}
\seclabel{benzo-nabujito}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this section we present \NBJ, a \B-based approach for a language-side \JIT compiler.
\NBJ goes even further than \WF using almost the same techniques.
However, instead of focusing on primitives, \NBJ generates native executable code for standard \ST methods.
Primitives tend to be more low-level, whereas \NBJ focuses on high-level \ST code. 


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\paragraph{The \JIT of the \PH \VM.}
The \PH \VM (Cog) already comes with a \JIT that translates bytecodes to native instructions.
It transforms \ST methods into slightly optimized native code at runtime.
The main speed improvement comes from avoiding bytecode dispatching and by inlining certain known operations and primitives \cite{Ayco03a}.
The most complex logic of the \JIT infrastructure deals with the dynamic nature of the \ST environment.
Methods and classes can be changed at runtime and that has to be addressed by the \JIT infrastructure.
The \JIT compiler, by which we refer in this context to the transformation of bytecodes to native code, represents a small part of the whole infrastructure.
There exists more important stages as an additional register allocation pass to reduce the number of stack operations \cite{Mira99a,Mira11a}.
The existing \JIT infrastructure is implemented in \Slang \cite[Ch.\ 5]{Blac09a} as the rest of the \VM.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\paragraph{Limitations of \VM-level \JIT Compilers.}
In the context of \NBJ we separate a \JIT infrastructure into separate parts.
The major part is to have a \VM that uses stack-mapping.
In the case of a bytecode-based interpreter, we assume that the \VM provides routines to switch between a bytecode interpretation context and a low-level native execution context.
With \NBJ we move the \JIT compiler,the part that generates native code at runtime, from the \VM to the image.%, the part that generates native code at runtime, typically from bytecodes.
 Since the \JIT compiler is quite decoupled from the rest of the \JIT infrastructure we believe that a hard-coded static and low-level implementation is not optimal for several reasons:

%\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\begin{itemize}
	\item Optimizing \ST code requires strong interactions with the dynamic environment.
	\item Accessing language-side properties from the \VM-side is hard.
	\item Changing the \JIT compiler requires changes at \VM-level.
	\item The \JIT reimplements primitives for optimization reasons resulting in code duplication.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Optimization Limitations for \PH.}
In \ST methods tend to be very small and it is considered good practice to delegate behavior to other objects.
This implies that several common optimization techniques for static languages do not work well.
Dynamic method activation does not provide enough context for a static compiler to optimize methods.
Hence after inline caches and register allocation the next optimization technique is inlining.
However, inlining in a dynamic context is difficult and requires hooks at \VM-level to invalidate native code when the language-side changes.
Since in \PH, compiling a method to bytecode is handled completely with language-side code most of the infrastructure to get notified about method changes is already present.

\paragraph{Primitives in the Existing \JIT.}
The existing \JIT reimplements the most used primitives at \VM-level.
This guarantees that the \VM stays as long as possible in the \JIT context (see \secref{benzo-jit-interaction}). Additionally this enables new performance optimizations that for instance are hard to achieve with standard compliant C code.
A typical example is the integer addition which has to deal with overflow checks and conversion of tagged integers.
In \secref{benzo-waterfall} we describe how \WF suffers a similar constraint. \WF manually defines such primitives in terms of native assembler instructions through the language-side \B interface.
\NBJ reuses the same optimized primitives so we rely on a single optimized definition which is shared amongst all native code libraries.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\paragraph{Implementing \NBJ.}
\NBJ is an experimental \JIT implementation which replaces the bytecode to native code translation of the existing \JIT infrastructure with a dynamic language-side implementation.
\NBJ is implemented mainly with a visitor strategy over the existing intermediate bytecode representation. 
Additionally we reimplemented vital native routines for the \JIT which are not directly exported by the \VM using \B. 
\NBJ relies on the following \VM-level infrastructure to manage and run native code for any \PH method:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item Fixed native code memory segments.
	\item Routines for switching contexts.
	\item Native stack management.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Dynamic Code Generation.}
%To simplify the implementation we decide to manually trigger \JIT compilation.
%For primitives known by \WF we rely on that infrastructure to generate the native code.
For standard methods \Nabujito takes the bytecodes and transforms them to native code.
It also applies optimizations such as creating low-level branches for \ST level branching operations like \ttt{ifTrue:}.
Optimizations for additional methods are all implemented flexibly at language-side.
Wherever possible, we reimplement the same behavior as the existing native \JIT compiler.
Eventually the native code is ready and \B attaches it to the existing compiled method.
When the language-side jitted code is activated \B ensures that we do not have to leave the \JIT execution mode, and thus we can call methods at the same speed as the existing \JIT.
%The benchmarks of section \secref{benzo-nabujito-performance} show the empirical results.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\paragraph{Outlook.}
\todo{move to separate section in the validation chapter}
One major performance optimization missing in both, the original \PH \VM-level \JIT and \Nabujito, is inlining. 
By inlining we are able to create methods that are potentially big enough for optimizations.
However, inlining is a difficult task in a highly dynamic language such as \ST or Self \cite{Cham89a}. 
Efficient inlining can only be performed with sufficient knowledge of the system. 
Accessing this high-level information from within the \VM is cumbersome and requires duplication of language-side reflective features.
The \JIT lives on the same level as the information it needs relying on the already present reflective features of \ST.

\todo{Collapse with previous usecase section}

\B allows the generation of specific and thus efficient native code.
In \secref{benzo-benzo} we explained how \B causes only a one-time overhead for native code generation. 
Thereafter it is cached for later activations.
The three use case presented in \secref{benzo-usecase} heavily benefit from this fact.
Even though the code generation at language-side is generally slower than a C-level implementation, the overhead can mostly be neglected.
Even better, for instance the \B-based \FFI implementation presented in \secref{benzo-ffi} outperforms a \VM-level \FFI-plugin due to a more flexible language-side implementation. 
These results are shown in the following \tabref{benzo-ffi-performance-simple}.

The rest of this section discusses in more details the performance of our three \B-base use cases: an \FFI, dynamic primitives and a language-side \JIT compiler.

% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{\B-based \FFI}
\seclabel{benzo-nb-performance}
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compared to a static plugin-based \FFI implementation \NB has only a one-time startup overhead with its numbers shown in \secref{benzo-issues-performance}.
Generating the native code at language-side is substantially slower than directly setting up all the conversions and calling the external functions from C code. 
In some cases the penalty for some compilation effort on \NB is as high as a factor of 100 compared to classic approaches.
Under the assumption that the method is called several times this overhead may be considered negligible.
An in-depth evaluation of \NB comparing against other solutions, is presented in \chapref{ffi}.
The following table contains a performance comparison of three different \FFI implementations for \PH that represents the typical showcase.

\begin{table}[!ht]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{rlr}
                    & Call Time                        & Relative Time \\\midrule
        \NB         & \ttt{10.53} $\pm$ \ttt{0.35} ms  &  $1.0\times$ \\
        Alien       & \ttt{31.09} $\pm$ \ttt{0.94} ms  & $\approx 3.0\times$ \\
        \FFI        & \ttt{19.55} $\pm$ \ttt{0.64} ms  & $\approx 1.9\times$
    \end{tabular}
    \caption[Basic \B-based \FFI Performance]{Different \FFI implementations in \PH evaluating 
    \ttt{abs(int)}. Alien does marshalling at language-side while \FFI does everything in C.}
    \tablabel{benzo-ffi-performance-simple}
\end{table}

\tabref{benzo-ffi-performance-simple} measures the accumulative time of 100'000 \FFI calls.
Included in these numbers is at least one additional \ST message send to activate the \NB method containing the actual call to the C function.
Each benchmark itself is run 1000 times and the average and standard deviation is taken.
We also measured calls with more complex type conversions where the performance boost against Alien pronounced even more because \NB's language-side marshalling is nativized.
The \JIT interaction described in \secref{benzo-jit-interaction} is also an important optimization factor especially when calling out small helper routines where the context switch from jitted mode is not negligible.



% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{\B-based Dynamic Primitives}
\seclabel{benzo-wf-performance}
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

For comparing performance we implement a very simple integer operation primitive (\ttt{$>$}) using three different approaches.
The first approach is the implementation with \WF.
The second is to run the language-side implementation that is triggered whenever the standard primitive failed.
Finally the fast standard primitive provided by the \VM.
We run the three approaches by measuring the cumulative time over one million primitive activations averaged over 100 runs.
The absolute numbers are less important than the relative factor between them.
We present the results of this experiment in Table~\tabref{benzo-waterfall-performance}.
%
\begin{table}[!ht]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{rrr}
					& Running Time 						& Relative Time \\\midrule
		\VM			& \ttt{  6.4}  $\pm$ \ttt{0.14} ms & $1.0\times$\\
		\WF	& \ttt{ 22.8}  $\pm$ \ttt{0.17} ms & $\approx3.6\times$\\
        Reflective	& \ttt{195.0}  $\pm$ \ttt{0.16} ms & $\approx30.0\times$
    \end{tabular}
    \caption[Basic \B-based Dynamic Primitive Performance]{Comparing running time of different implementations of integer arithmetic primitive.}
    \tablabel{benzo-waterfall-performance}
\end{table}
%
As expected \WF's solution outperforms pure reflective one by factor $9$ to $10$.
\WF clearly outperforms a purely reflective solution since all the meta programming overhead for the intercession mechanism is avoided. This results thus makes a whole new set of runtime extensions feasible that were previously limited by their strong performance penalty.
Furthermore the performance penalty over a completely optimized \VM solution that has extreme optimization techniques, such as inlining and register allocation, is less than a factor of $4$.
Applying standard optimization techniques, not yet implemented in \WF, will almost sure improve these numbers even more.
A more detailed analysis of \WF is available separately \cite{Char13a}.

% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{\B-based \JIT compiler}
\seclabel{benzo-nabujito-performance}
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The performance evaluation for our \B-based \JIT compiler is focused on the language-side code-generation part.
\NBJ essentially generates the same native code as the \VM-level \JIT, hence there is no performance difference at evaluation time.
However, \NBJ is clearly slower during the warm-up phase.
Compilation of the native instructions will take considerably more time compared to the \VM-level implementation of the same bytecode to assembler transformation.
The cost of transforming the bytecodes to native code at \VM-level can be measured in native instructions, whereas the unit at language-side is bytecodes.
However, we point out again, that this is a one-time overhead.
From the in-production experience of \NB, the \B-based \FFI (see \secref{benzo-nb-performance}), we know that these costs amortized, especially for long-term applications.
Instead of focusing on the final performance of the generated code, we present the compilation time compared to the normal \PH bytecode compiler, which also resides at language-side.

\begin{table}[!ht]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{rll}
                      & Compilation Time \\\midrule
        \PH Compiler  & \ttt{71} $\pm$ \ttt{1} ms   \\
        \NBJ      & \ttt{73} $\pm$ \ttt{1} ms
    \end{tabular}
    \caption[Basic \B-based \JIT Performance]{Compilation efforts of the standard \ST compiler in \PH and \NBJ for the a simple method returning the constant \ttt{nil}.}
    \tablabel{benzo-nabujito-performance-small}
\end{table}

In \tabref{benzo-nabujito-performance-small} we compare the compilation speed of the standard \PH compiler and \NBJ.
We measure the accumulated time spent to compile the method 1000 times.
The average and deviation are taken over 100 runs. 
The \PH compiler takes source code as input and outputs \ST bytecodes.
\NBJ takes bytecodes as input and outputs native code.

We see that in the simple case displayed in \tabref{benzo-nabujito-performance-small} \NBJ's compilation speed lies within the same range as the standard \ST compiler.
We expect that in the future we apply more low-level optimizations and thus increase the compilation time of \NBJ.
However, we have shown in the performance evaluation for \NB, the \B-based \FFI, in \secref{benzo-nb-performance} that even a rather high one-time overhead is quickly amortized.
Furthermore with \ST's image approach the generated native code is persistent over several sessions.
A subsequent restart of the same runtime will not cause the \JIT to nativize the same methods it did during the last launch.
Hence our approach is even valid for short-timed script-like applications as most of the methods will already be available in optimized native code from a previous run.

\section{Related Work}
\seclabel{benzo-related}
% ===========================================================================
\todo{find older versions with more related work}
\todo{ensure that the \FFI related work is not that much}

In the context of \B we have to respect a variety of related work spawning different abstraction levels.
On a more abstract scale \B allows for a new way of extending the complete language runtime, hence we classify the related work according the following categories show in \figref{benzo-extensionComparison}: general language-side extensions, extensions using reflection, \VM-level extensions, and hybrid approaches.

We present now an overview of the approaches used to extend a language runtime and expose their limits.
High-level languages are in general sustained by a \VM and a vast set of libraries written in the language itself. 
Extending or improving the existing language runtimes is a difficult task.
In most cases the \VM is considered as a black box.
Additionally the \VM is written in a completely different language using another abstraction level than the one it supports.
Typically high-level language \VMs are written in C or C++.
To address extensions in this context there exist some known approaches:

\begin{description}[noitemsep]
	\item[Language-side Library] based on implementing a new or existing library. 
	\item[Language-side Reflective Extension] relying on reflective features of the language. 
	\item[\VM Extension] by writing plugins or changing the core of the \VM.
	\item[Hybrid Extension] by accessing external libraries using \FFI.  
\end{description}
%

The relation between the side concerning the abstraction and implementation levels (\VM vs. Language) of these extensions is illustrated in \figref{benzo-extensionComparison}.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{extensionComparison}
	\caption[Language Extension Mechanisms]{Comparing different extension mechanisms: 
		a) language running on a standard \VM, 
		b) language-side implementation of an extension
		c) language using features from a \VM extension, 
		d) language using features from a separate \VM plugin.}
	\figlabel{benzo-extensionComparison}
\end{figure}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Language-side Library}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The most straight forward solution for extending a language is to write libraries within the language itself. 
This option provides the advantage that the aggregate behavior is accessible and evolvable for any language developer.
However, language-side libraries are constrained by the underlying managed language runtime.
The \VM separates the language from the low-level internal details.
As a consequence language-side libraries are not feasible for all feature requirements.
For instance the previously mentioned example of instrumenting the language runtime is not possible as a standard language-side extension without a considerable performance loss.
So, even though we prefer extensions and optimizations at language-side, there are certain limitations of a managed language runtime that can not be circumvented.
If all language-side optimization opportunities have been exhausted it is exposing the need to resort to lower level approaches.
%\\

\noindent\emph{Language-side libraries are constrained to the capabilities of the underlying \VM and thus not general enough. Additionally not all performance bottlenecks can be addressed at language-side.}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Language-side Reflective Extensions}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a subcase of the previous approach but in the context of reflective environments that expose particular characteristics.
For instance, Meta Object Protocols (\MOP) \cite{Kicz91a} based on reflection \cite{Maes87a} are used to define certain control points in the system to change the language.
By composing meta objects it is possible to even modify the semantics of the language. 
Several languages such as \ST, Python, Ruby\footnote{\url{http://www.ruby-lang.org}}, and others provide reflective capabilities with different depths \cite{Ande98a,Van10a}.
However, most modern programming languages only have very limited support for intercession.
Hence the possibilities for dynamically changing language semantics or features are limited. 
Furthermore reflective capabilities are hard to implement efficiently.
Reflection imposes substantial performance penalties on most computations by postponing bindings \cite{Male96a}. 
Nevertheless, there are exceptions for a subset of reflective behavior which are implemented efficiently using a high-level MOP \cite{Vran12a}.
Though these approaches remain as a few exceptions.
In the typical low-level \VM it is difficult to gain reflective access to language-side objects.
Similar to the previous case, our goal is to extend language features in a general way and it was shown that this is only partially possible by reflective extensions. 
%\\

\noindent\emph{Reflective capabilities are not enough for general extensions. Even when suitable, they usually pose a significant performance overhead up to the point where they become unfeasible.}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{\VM Extensions.}
\seclabel{benzo-vm-extensions}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Another approach is to attach plugins to the \VM.
Plugins are direct bindings to external libraries described at \VM-side or libraries linked to the \VM executable \cite[Ch.\ 5]{Blac09a}. 
They provide a performance boost in comparison to pure language-side solutions.
Using highly optimized native libraries it is straightforward to outperform code written at language-side.
However, plugins are commonly written in the same language as the \VM, at a low abstraction level.
Few exceptions are self-hosted languages \cite{Unga05a,Wimm13a,Rigo06a}.
To support a fluent development process, \VMs should come with an infrastructure for building extensions at same abstraction level than the language.
Instead they tend to be very complex and to have sluggish building processes. For example, only a few \VMs have high-level debugging facilities \cite{Inga97a,Unga05a,Wimm13a}.
Also from a \VM maintenance point of view, extensions have to be avoided if possible and should only be used for critical performance issues that can not be properly addressed at language-side.
An example of how the complexity of the \VM can affect development efforts is the core of the \Self \VM \cite{Unga07a}.
After reduced development resources parts of the complex but efficient compiler infrastructure had to be abandoned in favor of a more maintainable code-base.

\todo{properly integrate}
High-level low-level programming \cite{Fram09a} encourage to use high-level languages for system programming.
Frampton et al. present a low-level framework packaged as \textsc{org.vmmagic}, which is used as system interface for Jikes, an experimental \Java \VM.
Additionally their framework is successfully used in \textsc{mmtk} \cite{Blac04a} which is used independently in several other projects.
The \textsc{org.vmmagic} package is much more elaborate than \B but it is tailored towards \Java with static types.
Methods have to be annotated to use low-level functionality.
Additionally the strong separation between low-level code and language-side application does not allow for reflective extensions of the language runtime.
Finally, they do not support the execution nor generation of custom assembly code in the fly.

Other related approaches are \VM generation frameworks in general.
They try to abstract away the complexity of the \VM and use high-level languages as compiler infrastructure.
A very successful research project is \textsc{Jikes} Research \VM\footnote{\url{http://jikesrvm.org/}} (former \textsc{Jalapeño})~\cite{Alpe99a}.
It uses \Java to metacircularly define a \Java environment which then generates the final \VM.
A similar framework is \PyPy \cite{Rigo06a} a \VM framework including an efficient \JIT. 
\PyPy uses a restricted subset of the  \textsc{Python} language named \textsc{RPython} which is then translated to various low-level backends such as C or \textsc{Llvm} code.
There exist several different high-level language \VM implementations on top of \PyPy such as \ST \cite{Bolz08a} or \textsc{Prolog}.
However, its main focus lies on an efficient \JIT generator mainly for a Python interpreter, and not on a direct, language-side assembler interface.


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Hybrid Extensions}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The last approach is to reuse an existing library usually implemented in a foreign language.
The languages interact through a well-defined Foreign Function Interface (\FFI).
\FFI-based extensions are a hybrid approach between pure language-side extensions and \VM-side ones.
Interaction with native libraries is supported by a dedicated \VM functionality for calling external functions.
This allows for a smooth interaction of external code and language-side code.
\FFI-based extensions share the benefits of a maintainable and efficient language-side library with modest implementation efforts.
However, \FFI is only a bridge or interface for allowing the interaction of different languages. 
It is not possible to directly synthesize new native features from language-side.
For this purpose we have to interact with a custom-made native library.
From an extension point of view this is close to the \VM extensions discussed previously.

Additionally to the interface limitations, there exists a performance overhead in \FFI for making the interaction between different languages possible. 
This is due to marshalling arguments and types between both languages \cite{Fish00a,Repp06b}.


Other high-level languages such as \Lua leverage \FFI performance by using a close interaction with the \JIT.
\textsc{LuaFfi}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/jmckaskill/luaffi}} for instance is an efficient \Lua implementation that inlines \FFI calls directly into the \JIT compiled code.
Similar to \B this allows to minimize the constant overhead by generating custom-made native code.
\Luajit is mainly written in C which has clearly different semantics than \Lua itself.
Compared to \ugh{our} approach the efficient \VM implementation suffers from the shortcomings described in \secref{benzo-vm-extensions}. 

Kell and Irwin \cite{Kell11a} take a different look at interacting with external libraries.
They advocate a Python \VM that allows for dynamically shared objects with external libraries.
It uses the low-level \textsc{Dwarf} debugging information present in the external libraries to gather enough metadata to automatically generate \FFI\ugh{s}.
However, they do not focus on the reflective interaction with low-level code and the resulting benefits. 

\textsc{Quicktalk} \cite{Ball86a} follows a similar approach as \WF.
However, Ballard et al. focus mostly on the development of a complex compiler for a new \ST dialect.
Using type annotations \textsc{Quicktalk} allows for statically typing methods.
By inlining methods and eliminating the bytecode dispatch overhead by generating native code \textsc{Quicktalk} outperforms interpreted bytecode methods.
Compared to \WF \textsc{Quicktalk} does not allow to leave the language-side environment and interact closely with the \VM.
Hence it is not possible to use \textsc{Quicktalk} to modify essential primitives.

A notable exception to the metacircular \VMs mentioned earlier is the \Self implementation \textsc{Klein} \cite{Unga05a}.
Unlike typical other metacircular approaches it does not strictly separate compile-time and runtime.
The reified \VM concepts are available at runtime, which is a result from implementing the typical \VM pieces at language-side.
Compared to our approach, \textsc{Klein}'s bridging efforts are much more complete.
However, \textsc{Klein} is built on a completely new \VM infrastructure, whereas \B requires only few changes to achieve its functionality.

\seclabel{benzo-conclusion}
% ===========================================================================
\todo{Extend to full summary}
We presented \B, an integral approach for reflective high-level low-level programming.
Using \B we efficiently implemented at language-side three distinct language feature extensions that typically reside at \VM-level.
\B promotes a smooth and powerful interaction with the low-level world by dynamically generating native code from language-side.
This enables to exploit the underlying platform capabilities only when strongly needed without leaving the development platform and through a high-level programming interface. 
As a result, \B advocates the use of development tools and abstraction level of the high-level language for as much as possible or desired.

By combining high-level reflection capabilities with efficient low-level code we manage to do dynamic primitive instrumentation and reuse the code for primitive operations which is duplicated on the standard \JIT approach.
We also show that since \B caches native code transparently at language-side our \JIT compiler poses only a one-time overhead when generating native code. 
Finally, we also show how our mature \FFI implementation outperforms an existing C-\FFI implementation by a factor of 1.5 even though we control every aspect from language-side.


As a final conclusion, \B shows that promoting clear interfaces for controlling low-level code completely from language-side produces efficient solutions for system programming requirements without resorting to pure low-level solutions.
We showed that fostering the abstraction provided by high-level languages and resorting to the system programming capabilities of low-level languages only when completely needed is not only possible but profitable.
Furthermore we manage to considerably reduce complexity and code duplication which results in better maintainability.
