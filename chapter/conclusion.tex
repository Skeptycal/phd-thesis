\subsection*{\href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2048066.2048138}{Flexible object layouts: enabling lightweight language extensions by intercepting slot access}}
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This paper contributed to \chapref{reification}.
Slots and Layouts as described in this paper are used in \PH 3.0 and newer.
The original implementation presented in this paper was implemented in an older \PH 1.0 image and was ported to \PH 3.0 in 2013.

\begin{description}
	\item[Abstract:] \emph{
Programming idioms, design patterns and application libraries often introduce cumbersome and repetitive boilerplate code to a software system.
Language extensions and external \textsc{dsl}s (domain specific languages) are sometimes introduced to reduce the need for boilerplate code, but they also complicate the system by introducing the need for language dialects and inter-language mediation.
To address this, we propose to extend the structural reflective model of the language with object layouts, layout scopes and slots.
Based on the new reflective language model we can 1) provide behavioral hooks to object layouts that are triggered when the fields of an object are accessed and 2) simplify the implementation of state-related language extensions such as stateful traits.
By doing this we show how many idiomatic use cases that normally require boilerplate code can be more effectively supported.
We present an implementation in \ST, and illustrate its usage through a series of extended examples.}

\subsection*{\href{http://hal.inria.fr/hal-00840781}{Language-side Foreign Function Interfaces with \NB}}
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This paper served as the basis for \chapref{ffi} and discusses the \B-based \FFI implementation \NB in detail.
\NB is used in production in the \PH 2.0 and newer.

\begin{description}
	\item[Abstract:] \emph{
		Foreign-Function-Interfaces (\FFIs) are a prerequisite for close system integration of a high-level language.
		With \FFIs the high-level environment interacts with low-level functions allowing for a unique combination of features.
		This duality has a strong impact on the implementation of the \FFI: it has to be flexible and fast at the same time.
		We propose \NB a language-side approach to \FFIs that only requires minimal changes to the \VM.
		\NB directly creates specific native code at language-side and thus combines the flexibility of a language-side library with the performance of a native plugin.}

\begin{description}
	\item[Collaboration on First-class Layouts and Slots:]
		In a collaboration with To\-on Verwaest (\SCG, Switzerland) we built a first implementation of first-class layouts and slots in a \ST system \cite{Verw11a}.
		In Collaboration with Martin Días (\RMoD, \INRIA) this initial version was ported to \PH and is now used in the current release candidate \urlfootnote{\PH 3.0}{http://files.pharo.org/image/30}.

	\item[\AsmJIT 64-bit Assembler:]
		To reuse the original research compilation pipeline built with \P \cite{Verw10a, Brun11a} a 64-bit extension was necessary to the initial \urlfootnote{\AsmJIT implementation for \PH}{http://smalltalkhub.com/\#!/~Pharo/AsmJit}.
		The extension is included in the current stable \urlfootnote{\PH release 2.0}{http://files.pharo.org/image/20}.

	\item[Collaboration on the \WF Dynamic Primitives:]
		We collaborated on the \WF Dynamic Primitive compiler together with Guido Chari (\UBA, Argentina), which resulted in paper currently under submission\cite{Char13a}.
		The implementation is a prototype and is not used in production.

	\item[Collaboration on the Mate \VM Prototype:]
		In collaboration with Guido Cha\-ri (\UBA, Argentina), Javier Pímas (\UBA, Argentina) and Clement Bera (\RMoD, \INRIA) several stages of a prototype \VM were built.
		The implementation mainly follows the concept of an dynamic language runtime which controls every aspect at language-side.
		The current language runtime is in a early prototype phase that allows us to explore new \VM and language concepts, however it is not production ready.
		Guido Chari will further explore new concepts of Mate in his Ph.D.
		Clement Bera, after finishing his engineering contract at \RMoD, will continue to work as a Ph.D. on the same system.

	\item[\VirtualCPU Compilation Toolchain:]
		In collaboration with Clement Bera (\RMoD, \INRIA) and Igor Stasenko (\RMoD, \INRIA) we built a prototype compilation toolchain based on the original work of Pinocchio.
		The current implementation is a working prototype.
		Plans exist to integrate a streamlined version into \PH to server as a platform independent backend to our \B-based \FFI implementation used in \PH.

	\item[\NBJ Language-side \JIT Compiler:]
		As a third case study for the \B framework we implemented a language-side \JIT compiler. 
		The current implementation is a prototype that is capable of directly transforming simple methods to executable code.
		Unlike its \VM-level counterpart it is based as a simple visitor over the intermediate bytecode format already present at language-side.

	\item[Inspector Framework for \PH:] 
		An important part of reifying concepts is the possibility to inspect and manipulate these objects.
		We wrote a new inspector framework which is used in the latest \PH release.
		It allows to quickly define new views on domain objects, an indispensable requirement for interacting with complex data objects.
		Next to the everyday usage in \PH it is actively used for the Mate \VM prototype where we need transparent access to internal structures of the \VM.

	\item[Command Line Test Interface for \PH:]
		In order to perform continuous integration in a maintainable fashion we developed a new modular command line interface for \PH. 
		It is used in production on the \urlfootnote{\PH build server}{http://ci.inria.fr/pharo/} alongside with simple \urlfootnote{installer scripts}{http://get.pharo.org/}.
